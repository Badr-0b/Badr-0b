# Hey — I'm Badr 👋  
**Electrical Engineering undergrad • Embedded Systems • IoT • Hardware-Software Co-Design**

I'm a 2nd-year Electrical Engineering student building production-style embedded hardware and full-stack projects. I ship real systems end-to-end: schematic → PCB → firmware → cloud. I care about power integrity, modular hardware design, and hardware-software co-design for IoT, robotics, and edge AI.
